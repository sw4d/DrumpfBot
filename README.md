TrumpBot

This is a simple twitter bot that looks for the Don's latest tweets, evaluates them, then tries to sub the best words for some from a actual dictionary.

Issues
Retweets don't process well with the current code release.
When running this script it runs a puts intead of automatically sending a tweet. My reasoning is I like to run this thing a few times per each Trump's tweet just to see what it comes up with

If someone wanted to really deep dive into all the words Merian-Webster provides per call to their API I think some hyuuuuge improvements could be made to the logic behind what the roboTrump app spits out.
